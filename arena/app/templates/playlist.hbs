Player votes scores is based on per player per map/gametype combo.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>recently played: don't favor maps which have been played recently (this week).</li>
    <li>played lt. avg.: boost maps which haven't been played a lot.</li>
    <li>no team games: don't play team games with uneven number of players.</li>
    <li>less team games: play less team games when low number of players.</li>
    <li>not suitable size: min/max player setting for map is unfit for current number of players.</li>
